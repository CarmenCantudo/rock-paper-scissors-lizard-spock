# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, invented by Sam Kass, is an adaptation of the traditional game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors. It was popularized by Dr. Sheldon Cooper from "The Big Bang Theory".

In "The Lizard-Spock Expansion" episode, it is first used to resolve a TV-watching disagreement between Sheldon and Raj.

The player picks a variable and reveals it at the same time as the pc. The winner is the one who gets 10 points first. In a tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found.

Scissors cuts Paper, Paper covers Rock, Rock crushes Lizard, Lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes Scissors, Scissors decapitates Lizard, Lizard eats Paper, Paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes Rock, (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors.
